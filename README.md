# StillLearning-SmallStuff
Combining all my smaller entry level learning projects into one repository



Everytime I wrote a new program I saved it in it's own repository even though most of them are only a single small file.

Now my list of repositorys is getting waaaay too long, so I'm consolidating them all into a single repository until I work on a project that actually requires its own file.
